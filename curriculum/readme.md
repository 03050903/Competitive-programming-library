# ACM Currciulum

This is a training plan for anyone who wants to excel in competitive programming regardless of his knowledge and experience.
The plan is currently under development and being tested by the GUC ACM community. This plan is meant to be sufficient for
anyone. Some communities may offer sessions to explain topics. However, links will be provided for online material. If you want
to contribute to the plan to improve it, you can send me an email.

We will divide ACMers into three different levels (inspired by Codeforces):

- Pupil: beginner with no prior knowledge or experience in competitive programming. The target of this plan to be able to solve
CF-div2 AB(C)

- Specialist: has basic knowledge in most of the topics and good implementation skills. The target of this plan to be able to solve
CF-div2 ABC(D)

- Expert: masters basic algorithms/data structures and has good knowledge in most of the topics. The target of this plan to be able to solve
CF-div2 ABCDE

Problems without brackets should be solved regardless of their difficulty. Problems with brackets should be solved if they are
the easy or medium ones.
